# Banking System Project

This project is a functional implementation of a simple banking system in Python. It was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course offered by the Saylani Mass IT Training Program.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how a banking system works by implementing core functionalities such as:

1. Creating an account.
2. Depositing money.
3. Withdrawing money.
4. Checking the account balance.
5. Printing a transaction statement.

## Features
The banking system offers the following functionalities:

- **Account Creation:** Allows users to create an account with their name. The balance is initialized to zero.
- **Deposit Money:** Users can deposit money into their account. The deposit must be at least 500.
- **Withdraw Money:** Users can withdraw money if their balance is sufficient.
- **Check Balance:** Displays the current account balance.
- **Transaction Statement:** Lists all deposits and withdrawals with the updated balance after each transaction.

## Error Handling
The system includes error handling for:

- Depositing and Withdrawal amounts less than 500 or negative amounts.
- Attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the current balance.
- Handling invalid menu choices.

## User Interaction
The program provides a menu-driven interface, asking users what operation they want to perform. After completing an operation, the user is prompted to decide if they wish to perform another transaction.

## How to Run the Project
1. Copy the Python script into a `.py` file.
2. Run the file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the banking system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of Python to run the script

## Learning Outcome
By completing this project, I enhanced my understanding of:

- Functional programming concepts.
- Using dictionaries and lists to manage data.
- File handling for storing transaction records.
- Error handling and edge case management.

## Acknowledgments
This project was assigned as part of the **Saylani Mass IT Training Program** under the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course. The program has provided me with valuable learning opportunities and practical experience in Python programming.
